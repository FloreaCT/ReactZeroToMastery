When you change the state, you should not change the type of the new state. Ex:

this.state = {
    name: {firstName: 'Cristian', lastName: 'George'}
}

The only way
this.state.name.lastName = 'Alex'

The wrong way
this.state.name = 'Gabriel'
Or
this.state.name = 88

Using this.setState(
    this.state.name.firstName = 'Mihai'
    console.log(this.state)
)
will result in console.log printing previews state

In order to overcome this (although it is usefull in some situations)

this.setState takes 2 arguments. 
1st one is a function which will return the new state
2nd one is an optional function.

If you call the console.log(this.state) in the callback function, it will
print the new updated state
